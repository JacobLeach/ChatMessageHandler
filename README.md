Chat-Command-Handler
====================

A framework to handle chat commands such as "/someCommand" or "!command" for basically any chat program.

Some ready to use classes are included but the main focus of this project was to design the framework in such a way so that it would be easy to swap out certain parts of the implmentations provided with custom ones. 

Some of the things I wish to accomplish are:

1) Provide various useable implementations for all the abstract classes

2) More documentation

3) Full example (Perhaps a simple IRC bot)

4) Automatic command loading (all your commands would go into a folder and they would be loaded automatically)

5) More advanced permissions system

6) Implement Services and trasition from a CommandHandler to a full MessageHandler (IN PROGRESS)

7) Anything else I haven't thought of yet
