Chat-Command-Handler
====================

A system to handle chat commands ("/someCommand" or "!command") for any chat program.

My hope for this project is for it to be an easily used framework to handle chat commands with minimal effort. 

However, I would also like it to be easily customizable. 

The example I have is currently broken. I haven't written any unit tests yet but I hope to at some point.

Time to break it again.
